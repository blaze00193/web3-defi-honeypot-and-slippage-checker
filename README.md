# web3-defi-honeypot-and-slippage-checker

Cross-chain deployed Smart-contract to detect Honeypot and Slippage for DeFi tokens.

### How it works:

There is no magic only EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine) features are involved.
The contract simulate a **buy/approve/sell** execution in a single transaction and evaluate the results. Work with any UniSwap2 Router interface.

### Supported Chains

```
  Ethereum => '0xe7e07a2281f1e66e938ae7feefc69db181329f12'
  Binance chain => '0x385826FBd70DfBB0a7188eE790A36E1fe4f6fc34'
  Cronos chain => '0xb5BAA7d906b985C1A1eF0e2dAd19825EbAb5E9fc'
  Fantom Chain => '0x4208B737e8f3075fD2dCB9cE3358689452f98dCf'
  Polygon Chain => '0xc817b3a104B7d48e3B9C4fbfd624e5D5F03757e0'
  Avalanche  => '0xf3af9a948f275c2c3b9c61ade16540e66158a1d5' // Trader Joe '0x2B30ddE904B22c0Bba6019543231c857e0Be1DfB'
  Astar Network => '0x0aa2037E40a78A169B5214418D66377ab828cb23'
  DogeChain => '0x7c0612357771f6599e8e1a046a02f4beb9496de1' // DogeSwap '0xDB2135662F55C241EEEef9424B68f661d5c0D298'
```

### How to use?

There is a TypeScript code snippet (example/index.ts)

```
const RunHoneyContract = async (
  from: string, // Any existing address on the blockchain e.g. 0x573fbc5996bfb18b3f9b9f8e96b774905bcdc8b6 (find one from the Top Accounts https://cronoscan.com/accounts)
  to: string, // The Honeypot checker contract Address e.g. 0xb5BAA7d906b985C1A1eF0e2dAd19825EbAb5E9fc
  token: string, // the address of the token e.g. 0x062E66477Faf219F25D27dCED647BF57C3107d52 (wBTC)
  router: string, // the DEX router address e.g.  0x145677fc4d9b8f19b5d56d1820c48e0443049a30 (MMfinance router on Cronos)
  rcpAddress: string // Provide your EVM node e.g. https://evm-cronos.crypto.org
)

Result:
{
  buyTax: 0,
  sellTax: 0.3, // Passed 0.3% Tax detected
  buyGasCost: 0,
  sellGasCost: 0,
  isHoneypot: 0
}
```

### A Token Contract is failing on the Honeypot check why?

1. Required to have a native currency trading pair available (wETH,wBNB,wCro...). Why? because it make no sense to support route like WrappedCoin -> USDT -> AnyToken.
2. The available liquidity is lower than your simulation required
3. The Contract is broken or not satisfy the Uniswap2 de facto requirement. (Whitelisting, Blacklisting, Trade Disable, MaxTx, Disallow Buy/Sell in same transaction, MaxWallet...)

### Is this safe?

1. Slippage calculation already tested over 100.000 different Token pair.
2. Honeypot checking could be bypassed it is still blockchain, but the aim here is to decrease risk.
